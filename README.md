## Data
We use data from kaggle with the topic "World Population Dataset". The data is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/world-population-dataset. The data is a csv file with as primary columns:
* Rank: Population rankings by country in 2022
* CCA3: the country code
* Country/Territory: the country name

## Possible problems that can be solved with visualisation
* How is population and population density distributed around the world? (map)
* How do population and population density change rates differ across countries and continents? (line chart)
* What is the proportion of each country's population in its continent and the world. And how has it changed? (pie chart)
* Which countries and regions are the most populous and densely populated, and how have their rankings changed since 1950? (bar dynamic graph)
